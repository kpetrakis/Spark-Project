## Spark Project

Main Project for the course "Decentralized Systems for Big Data Managment(DDCDM)"

A detailed explanation of all the queries i had to implement can be found in spark_project_final-2021.pdf <br>

PartA/ and PartB/ correspond to the two parts of the project respectively. <br>

Project.ipynb notebook contains some early experimentation with Pyspark before commiting the final queries. <br>
 
Petrakis_Konstantinos_1041589.pdf is the final report.

Note: During the course i also had to make a presentation on a selected topic. I chose the paper Blockchain: An Introduction by A.Shanti Bruyn and the corresponding presentation is in Blockchain/.
